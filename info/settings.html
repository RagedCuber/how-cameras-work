          <h3>Aperture is the opening through which the light has to pass through in a camera between the glass lenses and the sensor. <br> Widening the aperture will increase the exposure because it allows more light to come in, decreases the depth of field by bringing the focal point closer to the photographer (because of a wider opening, same reflex angle, so distance of focal point is further) <br> Aperture is measured in units of f-stop, which is the focal length divided by your lens opening's diameter.</h3>

      <div class="content">
        <div class="text">
          <h3>Shutter speed is a measure of how long your shutter is opened, thus exposing the sensor to photons, measured in seconds. The greater the shutter speed, the more motion blur there is because of the subject moving, so the colors of the subject will be picked up by multiple spots of the sensor causing it to blur. Because the shutter is open longer it also allows it to let more light in on the same area of sensor, so the image will be more exposed/brighter.</h3>

        <div class="text">
          <h3>ISO is how sensitive the camera's sensor is to light. Modifying the iso increases the exposure/makes the image brighter, and the image quality goes down because you are adding a scale factor to the amount of photons, so any slight blemishes get scaled up. It is measured from a value called base iso of normally 100, which is the least sensitive, and goes all the way up to iso 12800, being the most sensitive.</h3>
