          <h3>The sensor is what actually captures the image. It measures how much light is actually hitting it, average out the photon energies, and then use that average value to generate a value for each pixel ove and over until the image is complete. So when the shutter release is clicked, the shutter opens, light goes through lens and aperture, the amount of photons and their energies is averaged for each pixel until a cohesive image is made.</h3>
