        <div class="text">
          <h3>The lens is the component of the camera through which light passes before hitting the sensor. It uses a series of convex and concave glass lenses to bend the light to acheive different focal legnths, as well as zooming in or out optically on one area of the image (no degredation of quality). Also is responsible for autofocus, image stabilization, and the aperture is located here too.</h3>

        <div class="text">
          <h3>The shutter release button will allow the mirror inside the camera, or the shutter, to let light come through the lens and hit the sensor, so it's primary function is to be the button which takes photos.</h3>

        <div class="text">
          <h3>The Viewfinder is the part of the camera you look through in order to preview the image that you are about to capture. It will always be what is actually in front of your lens, because the only processing that happens is image stabilization in the lense, so all the light coming through is directly reflected through to the viewfinder. It displays your camera settings and exposure meter, as well as autofocus points on the image preview. Main use is to give an idae of what your photo will be before you take it.</h3>

        <div class="text">
          <h3>The mode dial, as the name suggests, changes the mode which you take the photo with. What this means is it will (depending on the mode) automatically or let you manually change settings to capture the right style of photo. For example, manual mode lets you adjust all settings by youself, versus landscape mode which will have a small aperture diameter, moderate to longer shutter speed, adjust ISO based on the current lighting conditions, and have no points of focus.</h3>
