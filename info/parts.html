          <h3>The lens is the component of the camera through which light passes before hitting the sensor. It uses a series of convex and concave glass lenses to bend the light to acheive different focal legnths, as well as zooming in or out optically on one area of the image (no degredation of quality). Also is responsible for autofocus, image stabilization, and the aperture is located here too.</h3>
